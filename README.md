# The Coupled Rejection Sampler

This repository contains the companion code for the paper "The Coupled Rejection Sampler" by Adrien Corenflos and Simo Särkkä [1].

A proper readme is coming.

### Installation

Because JAX can be installed in different flavours (CPU only, CPU+GPU, CPU+TPU), we don't list it in the requirements.
To install it, please refer to the installation guide available on JAX
GitHub [page](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

Otherwise, simply download the repository and run `pip .`.

### Example

See the `examples` and `tests` folders. The examples implement the paper illustrations, while the tests test single functions behaviours and are a bit more low level.
